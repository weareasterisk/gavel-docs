# Gavel Administration

Once you create your gavel instance, you'll need to access the administration panel to manage judges, projects, and judging. This can be accessed at [{BASE_URL}](/deploy/configuration/#base-url)/admin.

Credentials for logging into this admin panel will be:


username: admin

password: [{ADMIN_PASSWORD}](/deploy/configuration/#admin-password)
